## What it does
This project provides information about the importance of environment friendliness and thinking about providing equitable access to all generations. We have developed a quiz type game that in an interactive way allows people to learn about sustainability and accessibility and rewards them for their practices using NFT from DeSo.

## How we built it
We built the main website using HTML, CSS, Javascript and the NFT minting page using React. The NFT is minted using DeSo Blockchain.
